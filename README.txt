Hi, I'm continuing a previous session.

Here's the summary of what was already done:

STATE SUMMARY
USER_CONTEXT
User wants to implement proper permissions for data entry users and track which users add content to the system. The user requested Arabic communication and wants data entry users to be able to add exams as drafts without being able to edit/delete them or access the /admin/exams page. After implementing user tracking for exams and questions, the user added an optional image upload feature for questions and now wants a database backup. The user has reported a formatting issue with the question creation/edit forms where the delete icon and radio/checkbox inputs have incorrect alignment.
